# gh-slack

This project provides a means of archiving a Slack conversation or thread as markdown. For convenience it is installable as a `gh` extension.


## Installation

    gh extension install https://github.com/rneatherway/gh-slack


## Usage

```
Usage:
  gh-slack [OPTIONS] [Start]

Application Options:
  -l, --limit=   Number of _channel_ messages to be fetched after the starting message (all thread messages are fetched) (default: 20)
  -v, --verbose  Show verbose debug information
      --version  Output version information
  -d, --details  Wrap the markdown output in HTML <details> tags
  -i, --issue=   The URL of a repository to post the output as a new issue, or the URL of an issue to add a comment to that issue

Help Options:
  -h, --help     Show this help message

Arguments:
  Start:         Required. Permalink for the first message to fetch. Following messages are then fetched from that channel (or thread if applicable)
```


## Limitations

Many and varied, but at least:

* No paging is used when fetching messages, so if the conversation is too long the output will be truncated.


## Development

To release a new version, simply tag it. The `goreleaser` workflow will take care of the rest. E.g:

    git tag 0.0.6
    git push origin 0.0.6
